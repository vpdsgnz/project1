**Description:**<br/>
A quick and easy way for players to set up a tournament roster with a Pokemon of their choosing. It visually helps players organize and keep track of participants and matches.

**Motivation:**<br/>
We initially wanted to create a Smash tournament thanks to mock game on Saturday during break. However, there was no Smash APIs so we thought of what would be another popular game for tournaments and chose to do it on Pokemon.

**Results:**<br/> 
Players can follow the scores and bracket progression. They can sign up with their name and Pokemon and be automatically added into the roster. They can check the stats of the Pokemon. 

**Team Efforts / Individual Responsibilities:**<br/>
Vanessa (front end): HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Material Design Lite
Jordan (back end): Javascript, brackets, Select2, APIs and Firebase.

**Improvements:**<br/>
We wished to have added an Admin page where moderator updated the scores and players, leaving the main page for only for viewing. Also, the Pokemon sprites in the brackets also needed to be bigger since it’s too small to see.
